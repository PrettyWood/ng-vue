# ng-vue

POC to illustrate how to dynamically switch between an AngularJS and a Vue.js entry point
By default, the AngularJS version will be launched.
To switch between the two entry points, just go in your console and use one of the commands
- `useVue()`: use the Vue.js entry point and reload
- `useNg()`: use the AngularJS entry point and reload
- `switchEntry()`: switch to the other entry point and reload

## Installation
```
yarn install
```

### Run locally
```
yarn serve
```
